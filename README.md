In order to ensure my code is working and secure, I make sure to always break things down into small testable pieces first. For example, with Project One, I've written unit tests to test whether each feature of the Contact Service works as it should: ensuring no two contacts had the same ID, for instance, or that invalid inputs were handled properly. These tests helped me catch mistakes early and gave me confidence that the program would work as intended. In terms of security, I focused on input validation to prevent bad data from causing problems. Going forward, I want to explore tools that check for vulnerabilities automatically so I can take security to the next level.

Translation of the user's needs is knowing what the program is supposed to accomplish. In Project One, that was pretty clear: IDs had to be unique; contact information had to be valid; updates had to be easy. I paid close attention to make certain everything in the design and the testing documented adhered to those objectives.

Whenever I am designing software, I start with the broad view, then narrow into the details. With the design for Project One, I wanted to make sure the classes and their relationships were planned out first, to keep it modular and easy to update later. Then I worked on one feature at a time, testing as I went. I've found that sketching things out - be it with a flowchart, or just some rough notes, really helps organize my thoughts. Once the basic structure is there, I get into an iterative process of testing and tweaking to make everything work smoothly. Designing software feels a bit like doing a puzzle, and finding the best way to put all the pieces together seems to be the most enjoyable.
